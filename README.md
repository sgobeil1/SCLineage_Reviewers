# SCLineage_Review

Code + small demo datasets for the clonal, spatial, and morphological analyses used in **Gobeil et al. (2026)**.

This repository is organized into **three pipelines**, each with its own **Guide** file (with detailed step‑by‑step demo instructions):

- **Clone parsing + clone-level quantification**  
  Guide: `Clonal Analysis/Clonal Analysis Guide.md`  
  Demo inputs: `Clonal Analysis/Demo/`

- **Spatial analysis of clone–cardinal class overlap**  
  Guide: `Clonal Analysis/Spatial Analysis/Clone Spatial Analysis Guide.md`  
  Demo inputs: `Clonal Analysis/Spatial Analysis/Demo/`

- **Morphological analysis (morphotypes + heterogeneity)**  
  Guide: `Morphological Analysis/Morphological Analysis Guide.md`  
  Demo inputs: `Morphological Analysis/Demo/`
